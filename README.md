# Sample : Analyzing climate-risk with location-intelligence products
Climate risk is increasingly important to wholistically understand risk. The sample uses Moody's Climate on Demand product to retrieve data for a set of location on nature made perils such as wildfires, floods, wind and winterstorms, to impact of sea-level rise, drought as well as earthquakes. 

With the sample, one can see the simple steps it takes to
- Retrieve financial loss metrics in USD for a given asset such as a building at a given location. 
- Retrieve damage and loss impact predicting future impact of climate change using scenarios such as RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (https://github.com/cihanb/sample-climate-risk-with-location-intelligence).
- Calculate a portfolio/group level impact score and financial loss metrics.
